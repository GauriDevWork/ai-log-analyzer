                            [content] => Explanation:  
The error indicates that the plugin is attempting to call a function named `xyz()`, but this function is not defined or accessible at the time of execution.

Likely Cause:  
The function `xyz()` may belong to another plugin, theme, or a core WordPress file that is not loaded or activated. Alternatively, the plugin itself might be missing a required dependency or initialization step.

Suggested Next Steps:  
Verify that all required plugins and themes are installed and activated. Check the plugin’s documentation for dependencies or prerequisites. Review the plugin loading order to ensure dependencies are available before the function is called. Enable debugging to gather more context about when and where the error occurs.

                            [content] => Explanation:  
This warning occurs because the `foreach` loop is being given a variable that is not an array or an object that can be iterated over. PHP expects an iterable argument, and when it receives something else (like null, boolean, or a string), it triggers this warning.

Likely Cause:  
The variable used in the `foreach` loop is either uninitialized, set to a non-iterable value, or the data it was supposed to contain was not properly retrieved or assigned.

Suggested Next Steps:  
Check the variable before the `foreach` loop to confirm it contains an array or iterable object. Use debugging techniques such as logging or inspecting the variable’s value prior to the loop to ensure it is properly set. Trace back to where the variable is assigned to verify the data source and confirm it returns the expected iterable data.

This notice indicates that WordPress has encountered a variable or index that has not been defined or initialized before use. It is a low-severity warning meant to alert developers to potential issues in the code where expected data may be missing.

Likely Cause:  
A piece of code is attempting to access a variable, array key, or object property that has not been set or declared yet within the WordPress core execution flow.

Suggested Next Steps:  
Review the context in which the notice appears to identify the undefined variable or index. Enable debugging with error logging to capture detailed information. Check for any recent changes or plugin/theme interactions that might affect core behavior. Avoid ignoring the notice, as it may point to a subtle issue that could cause unexpected behavior later.
